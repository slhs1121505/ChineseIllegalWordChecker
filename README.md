# Chinese Illegal Word Checker (Pinyin-based)

A Python GUI tool to detect illegal or sensitive Chinese words — including homophones — using Pinyin.

這是我用 Python 寫的檢查中文普通話的字是否為違規詞或是違規詞的諧音的程式，我使用到了 [pypinyin](https://github.com/mozillazg/python-pinyin) 和 `tkinter`。

## Features

- GUI interface built with Tkinter.
- Detects banned or sensitive Chinese words.
- Recognizes homophones based on Pinyin.
- Simple and lightweight.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `pypinyin` library (install via pip)

## Installation

```bash
pip install pypinyin
